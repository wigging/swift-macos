# üçé üñ• Swift Programming for macOS

There are plenty of books, videos, and online resources for developing iOS apps. Despite the fact that iPhone and iPad apps require a Mac for code development, there is very little information about actually creating native Mac applications. The examples in this repository and the accompanying website demonstrate various aspects of Mac app development using the latest versions of Swift and SwiftUI. Hopefully the examples and website will provide a useful resource for Mac developers. The website is available at https://gavinw.me/swift-macos.

## Examples

Example code is located in the `swift-scripts`, `xcode-playgrounds`, and `xcode-projects` folders.

## Website

The website is available at https://gavinw.me/swift-macos. It is generated with the [genja tool](https://github.com/wigging/genja). The website is hosted with GitHub Pages from the `docs` folder.

## Contributing

If you have questions or find errors in the code examples then please submit an issue. Pull requests for new code examples are not accepted because this repository is for my personal notes. However, pull requests to fix errors in existing code are welcome.
