Single-line comments begin with two forward-slashes `//` while multiline comments are wrapped with forward-slashes and asterisks such as `/* */`.

```swift
// This is a single line comment.

let x = 99.1    // Another single line comment.

/*
This is a multiline comment
that spans
several lines.
*/
```
